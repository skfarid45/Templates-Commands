Step 1: Create Load Balancer ( i am creating Application load balancer )
Step 2: Create Launch configuration ( Mention in RAM , CPU , PORT , HDD , OS -like config information for create the instance )
Step 3: Create Auto Scaling Groups. ( define limitations like min & max , if you not set this billing getting more you need to answer for client )
Step 4: Create topic in SNS ( Simple Notification Service - getting e-mail notifications)
Step 5: Create alarm in CloudWatch ( about server performance we should create alarm )
Step 6: Add policy in Auto Scaling ( we have policies one is increasing policy (ec2 machine) decrease policy (remove automatically))



Step 1: Application Load Balancer 
====================
1) Create a VPC 
2) Create Internet Gateway - Attach it to VPC created earlier
3) Create 2 Subnets on same VPC with two different Availability Zones 
     i) IPv4 12.0.1.0/24
     ii) IPv4 12.0.3.0/24
4) Create Route Table same VPC
     -- Go to subnet assosiations -- Then Edit subnet associations -- Select two subnets created earlier 
     -- Go to Route -- Edit route -- add route 0.0.0.0 -- select internet gateway then save
5) Create two EC2 one in each subnet both instance with same VPC 
     -- Edit network settings -- add HTTP port 80
     -- ADvance settings -- user data add this script i will save the script in different file
6) Create Target Group same VPC 
     -- Select both instance running and include as target below -- Then create Target Group
7) Create Application Load Balancer
     -- Same VPC -- Subnets both -- create security group inbound rule HTTP 
     i)Listeners & Routing add Target Group Created earlier 


SNS ( Simple Notification Services ) :
======================

1) Create SNS topic then create Subscibtion and approve request in the given email

Create Launch configuration:
======================
1) It is now exchanged as Launch Templates
2) Create with ec2 same subnet and security group

Create Auto Scaling Groups:
======================

1) Create from launch template not from directly ASG
