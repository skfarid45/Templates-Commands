1) AWS IAM (Identity & Access Management)

Purpose: Securely manage users, access, and permissions in AWS.

Key Concepts
Feature	    Meaning
Users	    Individual identities for humans/applications
Groups	    Collection of users with similar permissions
Roles	    Temporary access, mainly for services (EC2 -> S3)
Policies	Permissions in JSON using Allow / Deny
MFA	        Extra layer of security
Policy Types

AWS-managed policies

Customer-managed policies

Inline policies (attached to one identity only)

Interview Questions

✔ What is the difference between a role and a user?
✔ What is the default access when no policy attached? (Deny)
✔ What’s the IAM best practice?
— Least privilege, enable MFA, avoid root account.

🪣 2️⃣ Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Purpose: Object storage for unlimited data. 99.999999999% durability.

Key Concepts
Feature	Explanation
Bucket	Container for objects
Object	File stored in S3
Versioning	Prevent accidental delete

Block Public Access	Stop accidental exposure
Storage Classes Examples

S3 Standard (frequently accessed)

S3 IA (Infrequent Access)

Glacier / Glacier Deep Archive (cheapest long-term)

Intelligent-Tiering (auto optimize)

Data Consistency

Strong Read-after-Write for all operations now

Interview Questions

✔ Difference between S3 vs EBS vs EFS
✔ What is S3 consistency model?
✔ What is S3 durability vs availability?

📊 3️⃣ Amazon CloudWatch (CW)

Purpose: Monitoring, logs, metrics, alarms, dashboards.

Key Components
Component	Use
Metrics	CPU, Network, Disk stats
Logs	Application logs
Alarms	Trigger actions when threshold breached
Events	Automation / notifications (EventBridge)
Dashboards	Visualization
Interview Questions

✔ CloudWatch vs CloudTrail?

CloudWatch → Performance Monitoring

CloudTrail → API Logging & Security auditing

✔ Default EC2 monitoring?

5-minute metrics (Basic), 1-minute (Detailed)

⚖️ 4️⃣ Elastic Load Balancer (LB)

Purpose: Distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances.

Types of Load Balancers
Type	Best For	Target
ALB (Layer 7)	HTTP/HTTPS	Microservices, path & host routing
NLB (Layer 4)	TCP/UDP	High performance, static IP
CLB (Legacy)	Basic use cases	
Key Concepts

Target Groups

Health Checks

Sticky Sessions

SSL Termination at ALB

Interview Questions

✔ ALB vs NLB difference?
✔ What is Cross-Zone Load Balancing?

🔁 5️⃣ Auto Scaling & ASG (Auto Scaling Group)

Purpose: Automatically add/remove EC2 instances based on demand.

Components
Term	Meaning
Launch Template	Blueprint for EC2 launch
ASG	Group that scales instances
Scaling Policies	Rules to scale up/down
Health Checks	Replace unhealthy instances
Types of Scaling

Dynamic Scaling → CPU > 70%

Scheduled Scaling → Peak hours rule

Predictive Scaling → Machine learning based

Interview Questions

✔ What triggers Auto Scaling?
✔ How ASG ensures High Availability?

📢 6️⃣ SNS (Simple Notification Service)

Purpose: Pub/Sub messaging to notify multiple subscribers.

Billing Model

Pay per publish & delivery attempts

Common Protocols
Protocol	Example
Email	Alerts
SMS	Notifications
HTTP/HTTPS	Webhooks
SQS	Distributed systems
Use Case

Send alert → SNS → send to SMS + Email + Lambda

Interview Questions

✔ Difference between SNS vs SQS?
✔ What happens if subscriber fails to process message?

⚡ Real-World AWS Architecture Connection

Classic 3-tier setup:

Users → ALB → ASG of EC2 (App Layer) → DB
            ↑ CloudWatch monitors CPU
            │
            └ SNS sends alerts on scaling


Data storage: S3
Access Control: IAM

🧠 Quick Interview Rapid Fire
Question	Answer
S3 durability	11 nines (99.999999999%)
IAM default permission	Explicit Deny
CloudWatch default EC2 interval	5 minutes
ALB Layer	7
NLB Layer	4
Autoscaling main benefit	HA + Cost optimization
SNS uses	Pub/Sub alerts
